1. Import the cinema_app.sql in phpmyadmin. This sql file contains dummy data for cinemas, seats, and movie shows. Besides that,
   the movie data is obtained from TMDB API ('https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started').
2. Start the XAMPP.
3. Adjust your own ip address in file src>views>TicketBookingView.tsx (line 74);
4. Run api backend: php artisan serve --host=YOUR_IP_ADDRESS --port=8000.
5. Run front end application: npx react-native start --reset-cache.

I have tried to answer most of the questions asked. I may not have 100% correct answer. in my opinion, IT is evolved and I believe it is important that we keep learning the new technology. I am open and fast learner.
